Twitter Classic Extension

Twitter Classic brings back the old view to the Twitter (the one that was before January 2012):
- sidebar moved to the right side of the screen.
- @username goes before the real name.

Tested in Opera 16 and Google Chrome 29.

TODO list:
- Adapt it for Firefox and Opera 12 (Linux).
